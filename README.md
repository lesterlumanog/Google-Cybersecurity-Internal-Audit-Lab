<h1>Google Cybersecurity Internal Audit Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, we'll be dealing with a fictional scenario involving a small company that's growing and needing solutions to address security concerns. The internal security audit helps to identify and mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in order to ensure business continuity. We'll go over the situation and review the scope, goals, and risk assessment report generated by the IT manager. Using this information we'll conduct an audit utilizing a Controls and Compliance Checklist as well as provide recommendations.
