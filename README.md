<h1>Google Cybersecurity Applying NIST CSF lab</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab, we'll be dealing with a fictional scenario involving a small company that's growing and needing solutions to address security concerns. The internal security audit reviews an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations. It helps to identify and mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in order to maintain an appropriate security posture, to ensure compliance, and business continuity. We'll go over the scenario and review the scope, goals, and risk assessment report generated by the IT manager. Using this information we'll conduct an audit by completing a Controls and Compliance Checklist as well as provide additional considerations and recommendations. 
<br />

<h2>Scenario</h2>

- Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 
- The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   
- The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

<h2>Additional Considerations and Recommendations</h2>

</br>

- All Botium Toys employees have access to internally stored data including access to cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII. Not all employees need access to this information. Access to this information should be limited to employees who are authorized to. And then the time allotted to access this information should be limited. Establishing and implementing access controls pertaining to the principle of least privilege and separation of duties will remedy this.
- No disaster recovery plans are currently in place and Botium Toys does not have any backups of critical data. It’s important to have backups of data to restore and recover systems to minimize the negative impact on business continuity should an attack or other disasters occur. 
- Increase minimum password complexity requirements (e.g., at least eight characters, a combination of letters and at least one number; special characters).
- Separation of duties have not been established and implemented. To minimize negative impacts, no one individual should have control of critical processes (example: individual responsible for signing/authorizing paychecks should not also be the one creating them),
- No backups. See comment concerning disaster recovery plans.
- Establish a regular schedule for tasks and clarify intervention methods concerning the legacy systems in use. 
- Implementing encryption concerning customers' credit card information will help avoid protected data leaks and compliance violations. 
- Establish a password management system exists that enforces the minimum password policy’s minimum requirement.
