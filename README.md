<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab, we'll be dealing with a fictional scenario involving a small company that's growing and needing solutions to address security concerns. The internal security audit helps to identify and mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in order to ensure business continuity. We'll go over the scenario and review the scope, goals, and risk assessment report generated by the IT manager. Using this information we'll conduct an audit utilizing a Controls and Compliance Checklist as well as provide recommendations.

<h2>Scenario</h2>

- Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 
- The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   
- The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.
